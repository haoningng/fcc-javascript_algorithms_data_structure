# freecodecamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure

While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, I've learnt the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

I've also learnt to apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

Along the way, I've also learnt two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).

As part of this certification, I built the following projects and got all automated test suites to pass:

## Projects:
* [Palindrome Checker](palindrome_checker/)
* [Roman Numeral Converter](roman_numeral_converter/)
* [Caesars Cipher](caesars_cipher/)
* [Telephone Number Validator](telephone_number_validator/)
* [Cash Register](cash_register/)

### To run the test:
Copy the code from script.js and paste into respective links in README.md
